# Installation

Installing the IDE is a very straightforward process. Currently the only supported operating system is Windows, and even without the installer it's not guaranteed to work or be usable on any other OS.

The installation steps are the following:

1. Download the latest release from [the downloads page](https://ms-paint-i.de/downloads)
2. Run the installer
3. Default settings are reccomended, including the "Full installation", as it doesn't take up much more storage at all, and allows for easier usage
4. Run the IDE
