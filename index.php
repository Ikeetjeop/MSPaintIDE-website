    <p>MS Paint IDE is a program that can read a normal image file saved with MS Paint, and can then translate it to
        text with the ability to highlight the text in the image, parse the code, compile and execute it. It provides a
        clean and simple interface, with your actual programming in a program you and millions of others already know
        how to use, and already have. MS Paint IDE allows the use of external libraries, multiple classes, and much much
        more.</p>
