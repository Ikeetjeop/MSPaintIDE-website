It already is! I've been using MS Paint since its early stages of development and always will use MS Paint. I've always been a Rubba duckling and I think this project is amazing. I definitely vouch for this IDE and would recommend it over Eclipse, IntelliJ and even Notepad... but I cannot vouch for the sanity of the user after delving into such an amazing application.",
